## About the project

### Description

Veilum: Your message is your business. Stay connected without central restrictions.

Veilum is a next-generation messenger built around a federated network to protect your digital freedom. We believe the right to private and unrestricted communication is fundamental.

How do we ensure this?
- Federated network: Unlike traditional messaging apps, Veilum does not rely on a single central server. Each server node can federate with others, ensuring messages flow reliably even if some nodes go offline.
- Advanced end-to-end encryption: Veilum uses AES-256 combined with high-speed OCB mode, keeping your messages private while maintaining fast communication.
- Full functionality without compromise: Messaging, high-quality voice and video calls, file sharing, and group chats—all with privacy and resilience built in.

Why is Veilum your choice?
- Your data belongs to you: Messages are never stored on a single central server and cannot be read by unauthorized parties.
- Bypass local restrictions: Communicate freely, anywhere in the world, even under restrictive networks.
- Open verifiable security: Veilum is fully open-source, allowing independent experts to audit its security.

What to be aware of?
- Server load may affect performance: Calls and message delivery may vary depending on network load and the number of active federated nodes.
- Network growth matters: The reliability and speed of the federated network depend on active participation; low participation may reduce stability.

YOUR DIGITAL LIFE IS YOURS AND NO ONE ELSE'S

### Our goals
- Digital Freedom: Online communication should be unrestricted.
- Privacy First: Your security and privacy come first.
- Censorship Resistance: People must stay connected regardless of blocks.
- Transparency: Open-source development ensures users can verify security.
