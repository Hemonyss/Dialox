# Dialox

**Your message is your business. Never worry about being blocked again.**

## About the project

### Description:

**Dialox: Your message is your business. Never worry about being blocked again.**

Dialox is a next-generation messenger designed to protect your digital freedom. We believe that the right to private and unrestricted communication is fundamental.

**How do we ensure this?**
- Decentralized P2P network: Unlike traditional messaging apps, Dialox does not have central servers that can be disabled. This makes it virtually unblockable, even at the government level. Your messages are transmitted directly between user devices.
- Advanced end-to-end encryption: We use the time-tested AES-256 algorithm in combination with the high-speed OCB mode. This not only protects the content of your conversations from any third party, but also ensures high-speed transmission.
- Full functionality without compromise: Enjoy everything you're used to: lightning-fast messaging, high-quality voice and video calls, file sharing, and group creation - but now with a guarantee of privacy.
  
**Why is Dialox your choice?**
- Your data belongs to you alone: We do not store, read, or transmit it.
- Bypass any blockages: Stay in touch with your loved ones and colleagues anywhere in the world, regardless of local restrictions.
- Open verifiable security: Our code is Open-Source, which allows independent security experts to verify its reliability.

**Why might you not like Dialox?**
- Unlike other messengers, which have a centralized server and all messages go through it, in Dialox your device becomes a small part of a decentralized server, which can cause higher battery and data usage.
- Calls may be unstable or delayed under certain conditions, but these conditions are almost the same as in other messaging apps.
- Due to its architecture, our messenger depends on the number of its users, as they are the ones who transmit messages, calls, and other content to the intended recipients. Therefore, if there are too few users with server mode enabled and the load   is too heavy, the messenger's functionality may become unstable.

**YOUR DIGITAL LIFE IS YOURS AND NO ONE ELSE'S**

### Our goals
- **Digital Freedom:** We should be free when we're online.
- **Privacy First:** Privacy and security should come first.
- **Censorship Resistence:** Censorship should not prevent people from communicating online.
- **Transparency:** People need to see how the app works to be confident in its security.
